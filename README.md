- 👋 Hi, I’m @agaffoor-dev
- 👀 I’m currently interested in learning more about front-end and back-end web development. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning rust as I like going through a bottom-up process of learning to attain a deeper understanding of computers' inner workings. I'm intrigued by the memory safety and borrow checker features that Rust offers. I'm also going through the Odin project to kickstart my knowledge of web development with the goal of becoming a good full stack web developer.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate in any way that could help bring a project to a working standard.
- 📫 How to reach me: Reach me through github. I'll be happy to help in any way.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: Can't think of one at the moment.
